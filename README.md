## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Certainly! Here's the information formatted in Markdown:

#### CSS Custom Variables

- Utilized `:root` to define CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent color values throughout the project.
- Employed custom variables like `--primary-color`, `--grey`, `--dark-grey`, and `--off-black` for better code organization and easy global style changes.

#### Selectors and Styling States

- Used various state selectors like `:hover` and `:active` to create interactive and dynamic styles for the social buttons.
- Applied styles for different states, enhancing user experience with visual feedback on button interactions.

#### Dangling Element Selectors

- Applied styles to specific elements, such as `.avatar`, instead of using element selectors for more targeted styling.

These additions showcase your proficiency in utilizing CSS custom variables, styling states, responsive design, and other advanced styling techniques.
